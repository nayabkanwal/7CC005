# React Hero Editor and List Display

This document outlines the React application built to manage and display a list of heroes, allowing users to select a hero and view or edit its details.

## Overview

The application consists of several key components:
- `Hero`: Displays and allows editing of details for a selected hero.
- `HeroesList`: Displays a list of heroes and allows users to select a hero to view.
- `App`: The main component that manages the state and includes both the `Hero` and `HeroesList` components.

## Details

### 1. Hero Component

The `Hero` component displays the details of a hero. It allows users to view and interact with hero properties such as `name` and `id`.

### 2. HeroesList Component

The `HeroesList` component lists all heroes. Users can click on a hero's name to select it. The selected hero's details are then displayed in the `Hero` component.

### 3. App Component

The `App` component acts as the root of the application. It manages the state for the selected hero and passes it down to the `Hero` and `HeroesList` components. It also handles the selection of a hero.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**: The project is initialized using `create-react-app`.
2. **Hero Component**:
   - Created to manage and display details of the currently selected hero.
   - Uses props to receive hero data and display it.
3. **HeroesList Component**:
   - Displays a list of heroes.
   - Manages user interaction to select a hero and uses a callback to inform the parent component (`App`) about the selection.
4. **App Component**:
   - Manages overall application state including the selected hero.
   - Renders `Hero` and `HeroesList` based on the selection.

## Usage

Run the application locally by navigating to the project directory and using `npm start`. This will serve the app on a local server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet functional introduction to managing state and props in React, demonstrating how components can interact and update based on user interactions.

For further enhancements, consider adding features such as adding new heroes, deleting heroes, or saving changes to a backend server.
